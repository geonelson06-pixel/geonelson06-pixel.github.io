1. Share one technical concept that you developed greater mastery over in this project. Demonstrate how you understand that concept by sharing your mental model of the concept. Then, show how you used that concept in your project.

My Response:

One technical concept I gained greater mastery over in this project was Flexbox layout. My mental model of Flexbox is that it lets me control how items are aligned and spaced along a main axis and a cross axis inside a container. Instead of positioning elements manually, I let the container decide how its children flow.

I used Flexbox throughout my project to organize sections like form rows and groups of inputs. By setting containers to display: flex and adjusting properties like flex-direction, gap, and alignment, I was able to create clean, responsive layouts without extra CSS complexity.

2. Choose one project requirement that you found challenging and are proud of implementing. Describe what made it challenging and how you were able to implement the requirement by walking through your code as succinctly as possible. Remember that your audience does not know your code nearly as well as you do so you’ll have to break it down in a logical manner for them to quickly understand it.

My Response:

One project requirement I found challenging but rewarding was creating a clean, responsive layout using semantic HTML and CSS. The challenge was making sure elements were organized logically while still looking good on different screen sizes.

I solved this by structuring my HTML into clear sections and then using Flexbox in my CSS to control layout. For example, I grouped related inputs inside flex containers and used consistent spacing and padding so the layout adapted naturally. This approach made the code easier to read and the design more flexible.

3. How did you leverage AI to assist your development of this project?

My Response:

I leveraged AI primarily as a planning and learning tool, not as a code generator. I asked AI questions about best practices for portfolio structure, accessibility, and CSS layout concepts to better understand what I should build.

After receiving suggestions, I wrote and adjusted the code myself so I could explain every line. AI helped guide my decisions, but the final implementation and problem-solving were my own.
